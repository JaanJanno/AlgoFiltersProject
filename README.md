**Project [Filter comparison]: Comparison of efficiency of using Bloom filter/ Cuckoo filter/ no filter in adding values to the list**

**Team members:** Sander Tiganik, Jaan Janno, Careelika Liisi Kuik

**Project web site:** https://github.com/JaanJanno/AlgoFiltersProject

**Goals:**
* To implement a program adding input values to a list without filter or using either Bloom filter or Cuckoo filter.
* To analyze the difference of efficency of using the program with the three previously mentioned filter modes.
* To present the results of the previous points

**Hypothesis:** We assume that using filters fastens the process of adding values to the list.
